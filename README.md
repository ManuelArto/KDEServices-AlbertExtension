# KDE Services extension for Albert Launcher

![preview](preview.gif)

## Description

This is a [python extension](https://albertlauncher.github.io/docs/extensions/python/) I wrote for [Albert launcher](https://albertlauncher.github.io/).

It has the goal to match KDE services located in "/usr/share/kservices5/" like KRunner does.

## Installation

To install the extensions, run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir "~/.local/share/albert/org.albert.extension.python/modules/kde_services"
git clone https://github.com/ManuelArto/ "~/.local/share/albert/org.albert.extension.python/modules/kde_services"
```
